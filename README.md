### Hello there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Thomas, aka Zstorm999. Iâ€™m a ~~french~~ software engineer interested in a lot of fascinating subjects, but mainly in:
- video game AI :robot:
- generative design :paintbrush: 
- programming languages design :computer:


At the moment, Iâ€™m working on two side projects (outside of my daily job) :
- [organic roguelike](https://github.com/Zstorm999/organic-roguelike), an experiment to generate an interesting roguelike world that does not have this classic "squary" look to the rooms
- an improvement of my previous work on [tilemap editor](https://github.com/Zstorm999/tilemap_editor), a tool to design old-school tilemaps and scenes for video games (zelda style)

## Languages


![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Zstorm999&theme=tokyonight&layout=compact)

These are the main languages I work with. Nowadays I mostly code in Rust (because itâ€™s an amazing language) and Haskell (because I like to confuse people), but Iâ€™m confortable with any of those listed above.

## Requests :email:

If you have any thing you would like to be done, feel free to ask me ! Iâ€™m always happy to help if the project is interesting.

You can reach me on Discord : `Zstorm#2822`. Please say you come from github so I donâ€™t instant-block you (I donâ€™t usually do this, but who knows).

<!-- add email here -->


I can do discord bots :wink:

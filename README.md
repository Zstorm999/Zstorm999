### Hello there 👋


My name is Zstorm999. I’m a french software engineer interested in a lot of fascinating subjects, but mainly in:
- video game AI :robot:
- generative design :paintbrush: 
- programming languages design :computer:


At the moment, I’m working on a strategy/management game that best can be discribed as: "silk road, but in space". Stay tuned !

## Languages


![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Zstorm999&theme=tokyonight&layout=compact)

These are the main languages I work with. Nowadays I mostly code in Rust (because it’s an amazing language) and Haskell (because I like to confuse people), but I’m confortable with any of those listed above.

## Requests :email:

If you have anything you would like to be done (or need help/advice), feel free to ask me ! I’m always happy to help if the project is interesting.

You can reach me on Discord : `Zstorm#2822`. Please say you come from github so I don’t instant-block you (I don’t usually do this, but who knows).

<!-- add email here -->


I can do discord bots :wink:
